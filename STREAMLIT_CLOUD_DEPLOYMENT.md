## 🔧 **Important Notes**

### ⚠️ **Database Persistence**
Streamlit Community Cloud has **ephemeral storage**, meaning:
- Your SQLite database will reset when the app restarts/redeploys
- **Solution**: Export data regularly or use external storage

### 📊 **Data Backup Options**
1. **Manual Export**: Download database file periodically
2. **Google Sheets Integration**: Sync data to Google Sheets (can add later)
3. **CSV Exports**: Use the built-in export features regularly
4. **Upgrade Plan**: Streamlit paid plans offer persistent storage

### 🔒 **Access Control**
- App is **PUBLIC** by default (anyone with URL can access)
- For private access:
  - Option 1: Use Streamlit's built-in authentication
  - Option 2: Add password protection in your app code
  - Option 3: Keep URL private (share only with team)

### 📈 **Resource Limits (Free Tier)**
- 1 GB RAM
- 1 CPU core
- 100 GB bandwidth/month
- Perfect for team of 10-20 people

---

## 🔄 **Updating Your App**

Just push to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update app"
git push
```

Streamlit will **auto-redeploy** within 1-2 minutes! ✨

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **App won't start**
- Check logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- Ensure `app.py` is at root of repository

### **Database keeps resetting**
- This is normal for free tier
- Export important data regularly
- Consider upgrading to paid plan for persistence

### **App is slow**
- Free tier has resource limits
- Optimize your queries
- Consider caching with `@st.cache_data`
