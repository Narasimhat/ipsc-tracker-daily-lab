A: Yes, but track who has what access for security purposes.

**Q: "What if someone forgets their credentials?"**
A: Securely share them again using the same method.

**Q: "Should I change passwords regularly?"**
A: Yes, especially when people leave the lab or if you suspect compromise.

## üéØ **START HERE**

**Most common setup for a typical lab:**

1. **Give yourself Admin access first** - test everything
2. **Give 1-2 senior people Pro access** - let them test advanced features  
3. **Give most lab members Member access** - daily culture workers
4. **Give supervisors/collaborators Viewer access** - oversight only

**You can always upgrade someone's access later!** Start conservative and expand as needed.
