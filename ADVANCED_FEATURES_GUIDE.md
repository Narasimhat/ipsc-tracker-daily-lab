```toml
[users.admin]
email = "admin@lab.com"
name = "Lab Administrator"
hashed_password = "GENERATED_HASH_HERE"
role = "admin"
team = "Admin Team"

[users.researcher1]
email = "researcher@lab.com"
name = "Research Scientist"
hashed_password = "GENERATED_HASH_HERE"
role = "pro"
team = "iPSC Team"
```
